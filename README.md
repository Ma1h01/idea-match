## How to run
Run in an iOS simulator (Make sure you have Xcode installed):  
`npx repo run:ios`

Run in an Android simulator (Make sure you have Android Studio installed):  
`npx repo run:android`

Run in a web browser:  
`npx expo start --web`

## Important
1. Do not modify the `ios/`. Expo will handle the iOS build for us.
2. `App.tsx` is the application entry point.
3. Write code in the `app/`.
